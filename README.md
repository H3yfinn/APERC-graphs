# APERC-graphs
Repo for hosting graphs so that i can share them with others easily. Especially useful for html Plotly graphs

Links to access the files: (if you cannot find the link for a graph in this repo then use the filename of that graph and add it onto https://h3yfinn.github.io/APERC-graphs/ like you will see below)
